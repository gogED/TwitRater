# TwitRater
A simple Twitter approval analysis tool

# How does it work?
Elon musk added the views feature for every tweet back in december of 2022. Using the likes and views of a tweet, we can evaluate the quality of a tweet.
The average ratio of likes to views is 1:100, so the formula is based on that. For example, if a tweet has 1 like and 100 views, the output value will be "1", that is the control of a tweet. If it's good, it should be higher than 1. If it's bad, it should be lower than 1.
